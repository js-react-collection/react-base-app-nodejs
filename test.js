// info:
// This is a basic concept of async functions.
// You can see how asyc are a sequenzial tasks except
// that one with await. In that one case, the stack of that function
// into the event loop is detached and frozen waiting for
// its result and all other tasks slide on end of stack.
// Async respect its scope, all other functions run, but
// the one with with that await is in "async status"
